##
This project is a Modular Penetration Testing Toolkit designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts, ethical hackers, and students to simulate real-world reconnaissance and exploitation techniques in a controlled environment. Developed in Python, the toolkit provides a command-line interface (CLI) that integrates multiple essential components of a penetration testing workflow — all in one convenient and extensible script.

The goal of this toolkit is to streamline common offensive security tasks, such as port scanning, SSH brute forcing, subdomain enumeration, directory brute forcing, and banner grabbing. Each function is implemented as a separate module and invoked via subcommands, making the tool both modular and easy to extend for future use cases or more advanced techniques.

✳️ Features
Port Scanner: Scans a target host to detect open TCP ports using socket connections. This helps identify exposed services and evaluate a system’s network security posture.

SSH Brute Forcer: Performs a brute-force attack on the SSH service of a target host using a provided username and a password wordlist. This module is useful for testing the strength of SSH credentials and simulating real-world password attacks on remote servers.

Subdomain Enumerator: Discovers potential subdomains of a given domain by using a wordlist-based DNS resolution approach. This helps uncover attack surfaces not exposed through the main domain.

Directory Brute Forcer: Performs a directory brute-force attack on a given URL using a wordlist, mimicking the behavior of tools like DirBuster or gobuster. It helps in discovering hidden endpoints, admin panels, or unsecured directories on web servers.

Banner Grabber: Connects to a service running on a specific port and extracts the service banner. This is useful for identifying software versions and detecting potential vulnerabilities.
